## Overview
This survey explores the expansion of **Transformer architectures** beyond their original success in natural language processing (NLP). It analyzes how transformers have been adapted for use in **computer vision**, **speech processing**, and **multimodal learning**, with detailed discussion of:
- Architecture variations (ViT, wav2vec, CLIP, etc.)
- Use cases like image classification, speech recognition, and vision-language alignment
- Unified models such as Perceiver IO, Gato, and Google Gemini
- Research challenges and future directions

---

## Highlights
- In-depth coverage of state-of-the-art transformer models  
- 5 custom diagrams illustrating architectures and workflows  
- Future-focused: AGI potential, lifelong learning, federated deployment  
- Suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners in ML/AI
